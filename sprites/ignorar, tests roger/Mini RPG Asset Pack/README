Thank you for downloading my 'Mini RPG Asset Pack'!
Feel free to use these assets in any way you like in your games.

A couple of useful things to keep in mind when using these sprites:
- All the animated sprites are contained in animation sprite sheets. The character sprites are in a 16x16 pixel grid (except for the 'player_attack' animations) and DO NOT contain ANY padding or spacing
- The 'player_attack' animations are in a 32x32 pixel grid and also do not contain any padding or spacing

It is prohibited to resell these assets or claim them as your own.
Feel free to check out my other assets/works!
